    <h2>Eagle Scout</h2>
    <p> Ian was involved with the Boy Scouts from his childhood until he aged out of the program at 18 years of age. Throughout his time in the program he commited 
      countless hours of cheerful service for the community and contributed to his troop as Assistant Senior Patrol Leader, the second highest youth position in a
      troop. He attained the rank of Eagle after completing his project, wherein he donated a box for the respectful disposal of American flags to a local church 
      and its community.

    <h2>Other Service</h2>
    <p>Outside of the scouts, Ian served as the head of the programming team for his highschool robotics team and helped to teach younger members the principles of
      programming and software engineering and managed the team to complete the project on time. He also helped out at a daycare operated by his family by helping
      watch children and contributing to community events. </p>
      <p>Ian hopes to someday return to the programs which shaped his growth by contributing to the journeys of other young scouts and those in engineering programs
        at the highschool level.
