        <p class="timeline_bold">Computer Design</p>
        <p>I designed a simple computer for a computer architecture class on a simulator which was able to run a subset of the available commands 
            in assembly. I was able to compile and run several small programs on this computer performing simple calculations such as matrix addition.

        <p class="timeline_bold">Terminal</p>
        <p>For an Operating Systems class I was called to design a functioning Terminal which was able to handle functions such as looking at files, 
            calling commands and programs, and redirecting the outputs of these commands to other commands or save the output to a file.  </p>

        <p class="timeline_bold">Java FX Connect 4</p>
        <p>I designed a simple Connect 4 game in Java FX which featured an AI opponent operating using the A* pathing algorithm. You could adjust how far 
            ahead the AI would look by changing the difficulty setting.

        <p class="timeline_bold">Database</p>
        <p>In Highschool, I was asked by a local business to design a simple database system for managing inventory. The project was never completed, as the client
            decided to stick with their old Excel based system for unrelated reasons, but by that time the system was able to handle User management and tracking, 
            the addition of new users to the system with join codes, basic inventory management, and a proof of concept was created for reading barcodes with a camera.
            The frontend was written in C++ using Webassembly and the QT framework with a backend written in Javascript.
